# Cake Eaters

We are the Cake Eaters Development Team. We make games and programs.

## HOW TO CONTACT
-----------------

Please email us at fnafgamerbusiness@gmail.com for any questions, or to join the team.
If you want access to internal repositories, please read the following.

## INTERNAL REPOSITORY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------
*1. You MUST not download the files, and send them to other people without our permission. If you do so, you will lose access to all Cake Eaters repositories.
*2. Don't make useless commits that fix nothing. If you do, that's just being stupid. Please don't.
*3. To attempt to get access, you have to be in the cakeDev Discord Server and go to the #request-repo-access channel. OPTIONAL: You can also connect your GitHub account to your Discord profile that way it's easier for me to add you to the repo. If you don't want to do that, you can dm me your username.

## HOW TO BE ACCEPTED ONTO TEAM
-----------------------------------

First off, you'd want to email us at fnafgamerbusiness@gmail.com. If I (cakeDev45) respond, I'll let you know if you've been selected to join. The requirements are: You need to have some level of experience with C#, and UE4. If you do, its a high chance that you'll be accepted onto the team. If you want to be a composer, you have to know how to make music (duh). And if you want to be an artist, well, you should know.

That's all from us, we hope you like our games!
Until next time,

All of us from Cake Eaters.
